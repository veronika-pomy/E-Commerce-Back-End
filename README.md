[![License][license-shield]][license-url]

## Description

This application is a back-end application for an e-commerce business designed for managers and other users to be able to access, create, update, and delete stored data. 

App functionality: 

- When a user adds a database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file, they are able to connect to a database using Sequelize
- When a user enters schema and seed commands, a development database is created and seeded with test data
- When a user enters the command to invoke the application, the server is started, and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
- When a user opens API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags, the data for each of these routes are displayed in a formatted JSON
- When a user tests  API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core, they are able to successfully create, update, and delete data in the database
